      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
      kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally
      means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
      used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known
      as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
      sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic
      football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena
      football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby
      league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of
      football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
      "football codes".
